# Placement Portal

This is a Placement Portal built using HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. It uses a MySQL Database, and XAMPP to manage all this. 

There are 2 portals in this project, namely, a student portal and admin portal.

## Student Portal

The student portal begins with a signup page which will take basic info about student including a resume, followed by a login page. 

The main homepage contains all the jobs currently active. By clicking on a job card, a page will open containing all the details about it in depth. The student can apply for the job from here. 

There is an applications page, which will show all the jobs the student has applied to. Inside an application, the student will find his application status like Applied, Selected for OA, Selected for Interview, Selected for GD, Accepted, Rejected, On Hold, etc.

## Admin Portal

The admin portal will only contain a login page, since accounts will be directly created from the database. 

The main homepage contains all the jobs currently active. By clicking on a job card, a page will open containing all the details about it in depth. The admin will get an option to edit job details, like CGPA criteria, 10th 12th marks required, live/dead KT restrictions etc. Admin will also get a list of all students who have to this, along with their details, and download their resume. Admin can update status of a student's application for a job. There will be an option to export all applications data to CSV.
